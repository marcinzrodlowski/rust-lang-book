# Rust-Lang Book Journey

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marcin, and this is my learning journey through the Rust programming language. Currently, I'm navigating through the Rust-Lang Book online, page by page, to grasp the ins and outs of this powerful language.

## What's Inside

- **Learning Progress**: You'll find updates on the pages I've covered, my thoughts, and any challenges I've encountered.

- **Code Samples**: I'll be sharing snippets of code that I find interesting or challenging. Feel free to dive in, and let's learn together!

## Why Rust?

Rust has caught my attention for its focus on performance, memory safety, and concurrency without sacrificing developer productivity. I'm excited to explore its features and understand how it can enhance my programming skills and eventually how can I benefit from using it in my web3 journey.
